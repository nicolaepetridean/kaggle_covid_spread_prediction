### Additional Data
#### Containment and mitigation measures dataset
- provides description and start-dates of containment measures against Covid-19
- correlates with decreasing number of new cases
- most promising additional data
- Next step: find categories for description using word clouds or similar

#### Weather data
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) provides historic weather information and forecast
- Next steps: look further into data what kind of data is provided and how to access

#### Public transport data
- too hard to obtain for each country individually, but very detailed overview is provided for some countries
- Google Transit API could be promising but is aimed at public transport companies to provide data for Google maps
- Next steps: find broader statistics for public transport
